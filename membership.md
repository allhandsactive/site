## AHA _is_ its members!
{: .text-center}

Becoming a member is the best way to support AHA. Our members' skills, passion
and desire to share knowledge are what make AHA!  great. Members also gain
access to low- and high-tech tools and equipment most people wouldn't likely
have at home (CNC/Laser Cutter/3D Printer/Vinyl Cutter).
{: .text-justify}

We offer many **membership options** to suit your means and style.
{: .text-center}

{% include feature_row id="feature_row1" %}

All members are eligible for an any-time access badge for the space and are
eligible to vote and run in board elections. Members can also take all tool
training class for $20 with free refreshers and have access to temporary
storage lockers.  Members also get access to a members email list.

All members are expected to contribute to the basic maintenance of the space:
replenish what you use, leave the space cleaner than you found it, and expect
at least an hour per month of involvement from keeping track of the happenings
on the mailing list to fixing something that's broken.

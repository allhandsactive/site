  committed to sharing and democratizing technology&mdash;from
  circuitboard prototyping to spinning wool.
  Founded in 2009, AHA! is Ann Arbor's original makerspace and
  hackerspace. We centralize resources, tools, and expertise for
  _learning_, _making_, and _doing_."

**AHA! is a space to create.** We help with a wide assortment of processes like
soldering, sewing, laser cutting, software development, 3d printing, CNC
routing, app development, carpentry, machining, Arduino and embedded systems
programming. Our goal is to make technology and fabrication as fun and
empowering as playing with Legos. We put diverse skills and equipment under one
roof to accommodate the unanticipated needs of creative and innovative projects.

We believe that **if you can't fix it, you don't own it**. At AHA! you can take
apart the things you take for granted: learn how they work and how to adapt
them to _your_ purposes!

We make Ann Arbor smarter by hosting classes and workshops, sharing our skills,
making our tools and workshop accessible to the wider community, and
cultivating a welcoming community of hackers, makers and creative types.

We strive to be as accessible as possible with low costs, classes and a
welcoming environment for all. Good things happen when we lower barriers
between people and their creativity.
